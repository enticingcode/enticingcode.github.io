                <p>As a someone who has always been passionate about new technology,
                    I still somehow managed to struggle finding my true "calling".
                    I've gone from working retail, food, warehouse, to service industries with to no avail.
                    When finally thanks to a friend of mine I decided to take a serious crack at some sort of
                    development, which landed me here.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Thanks to The Odin Project along with a handful of other helpful resources I have
                    finally found something that I can truly say interests me in a way nothing else has and that is due to its
                    challenging and creative nature.
                </p>

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p> I breifly touched on how new Technology has always fascinated me,
                    but along with that I have always been interested in learning all sorts of cool things.
                    Some of my general interests, but not limited to are:
                    <ul>

                        <li>Videography</li>
                        <li>Design</li>
                        <li>Anime</li>
                        <li>Newly found interest in Mountain Biking</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div >
